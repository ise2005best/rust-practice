## Rust Fundamentals

**Project Description:**

This directory serves as a learning resource for exploring the fundamentals of the Rust programming language, with a specific focus on their application in Operating Systems concepts. It contains various code examples and exercises designed to:

**Learning Objectives:**

* **Mastering core concepts:**
    * **Structs:** Organizing and defining data structures for system resources.
    * **Traits:** Implementing interfaces for different system components.
    * **Functions:** Writing reusable code for operating system functionalities.
    * **Enums:** Representing different states and events in the system.
    * **Arrays:** Managing collections of data structures efficiently.
    * **Literals:** Defining fixed values for system parameters.
    * **Pointers:** Manipulating memory and data directly for low-level operations.
    * **Operators:** Performing operations on system resources and data.
* **Developing practical skills:**
    * Applying learned concepts to solve real-world operating systems problems.
    * Experimenting with different approaches and techniques for system management.
    * Gaining hands-on experience with the Rust syntax and tooling for systems programming.
    * Enhancing knowledge acquired in CSC305 (Operating Systems II) taught by Dr. Pius Onobhayedo Github: [https://github.com/piosystems](https://github.com/piosystems)
* **Building a strong foundation:**
    * Acquiring a solid understanding of Rust programming fundamentals.
    * Preparing for further learning and exploration of advanced operating systems topics.

**Structure:**

This directory is organized into subdirectories, each focusing on a specific concept:

* Each subdirectory includes:
    * **Explanation:** A concise overview of the concept with relevant examples and their application in operating systems.
    * **Exercises:** A set of practice problems for applying the learned concept to solve operating systems-related challenges.
    * **Solutions:** (Optional) Solutions to the exercises are provided for reference and verification.

**Target Audience:**

This resource is intended for individuals:

* With no prior experience in Rust who want to learn the fundamentals for operating systems.
* Seeking to solidify their understanding of operating systems concepts through hands-on Rust practice.
* Enrolled in CSC305 (Operating Systems II) or similar courses and looking for supplemental learning materials.

**Additional Resources:**

* The Rust Programming Language Book: [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
* Rust by Example: [https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
